Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Will Bridges

2. What hostname did you deploy your app to?
hw04.willbridges.website

3. What's the URL of your git for this assignment?
https://github.com/willpbridges/cs4550-hw04

4. How much of the functionality did you complete?
All of it

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?
Yes

6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?
Somewhat more comfortable than when I started, but I still don't
exactly enjoy it.

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
My first roadblock was understanding how the controller functions
worked so I could properly render my palindrome page. After that, I
struggled with the calculator long time. Fundies 1 was a long time
ago, and I also just had a lot of trouble understanding syntax
and how certain elixir/erlang functions worked. After all my
functions worked, it took me a while longer to figure out how to
deploy and successfully create the systemd process.
